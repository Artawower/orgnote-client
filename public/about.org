* [#A] Org Note
[[https://github.com/Artawower/orgnote][OrgNote]] - is a knowledge base based on [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org roam]], a package for working with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]].
/The current version of the program is a prototype, it contains some bugs and is not stable enough/. Please be sympathetic :)

* [#B] Manifesto
The main idea of the project is to provide full-fledged integration for OrgRoam for desktop, mobile apps and web interface (+pwa).

- The project should be free for everyone (/except for some premium features that require hardware resources/).
- This is an open-source project, so anyone can contribute to it and see how it works internally.
- The project should be community-oriented, so if you have ideas, please share them with me.
  /You are also my patron, you can vote to prioritize certain features/.
- The project should be free (including premium features) for open-source developers.
  /It's hard to share with everyone, but I'll try/ :)
- It does not collect personal data and has no trackers.

* [#C] Limitations
- There is currently no support for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type][CRDT]]. This means that if you use synchronization via =orgnote-cli= you may lose some data.
  (it should automatically back up if you use it inside emacs with [[https://github.com/Artawower/web-roam.el][orgnote.el]]
  *Make sure you back up your data!*
- There are no migrations in the project! I'm focusing on implementing the core functionality of the core.
  This means that if you make changes to the program, you may lose your data. *Definitely back up your data!*
- I made AST from scratch and not all org-mode primitives are supported now, also the parser might lack some rules.
  Please, if you encounter such bugs, let me know via GitHub [[https://github.com/Artawower/orgnote/issues][issue]].
- The design is not in its final state... I'm not a designer, so I'd be glad if someone could help me with this ðŸ˜Š.
- The version for ios devices is not published. I will publish it when we raise enough money for [[https://www.patreon.com/artawower][patreon]] (~$120/year)
  /You can freely use the *PWA* version for your apple devices right now.

* [#D] Plans
I have a bunch of plans to integrate org-mode into a mobile app, some of them require a lot of time and resources, some will just be plans.
But the ideal program should include:

- Configuration through competent programming
- Linking and executing blocks of src code
- Support for extensions
- CRDT support for seamless synchronization
- Full support for all org mode primitives
- Mobile notifications for your agenda
- Integration with third-party programs
* [#E] Contribution
If you would like to help me with the project, you can do so in a variety of ways:
- Help me with debugging and some features (please read the contribution guide before doing so)
- Star github [[https://github.com/Artawower/orgnote][repo]]
- Help with alpha testing
- Consider becoming my [[https://www.patreon.com/artawower][patron]]
- + Share this project with your friends+ It's still early :)
